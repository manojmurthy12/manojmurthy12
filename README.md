Hi there ðŸ‘‹
As a software engineer with a keen eye for technical precision and user-focused design, my background spans C++ workflows, and I enjoy building interfaces with Node.js and Electron to improve efficiency. Iâ€™ve also worked on real-time communication solutions, including an intranet-based video conference application powered by WebRTC.

Lately, my focus has expanded to web3 and Rust, where Iâ€™m eager to push the boundaries of decentralized tech. I thrive in collaborative environments where creativity meets technical rigorâ€”letâ€™s connect to create impactful solutions!

 - ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently expanding my Rust skills with Solana program development.
 - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m exploring advancements in real-time communication and system integrations.
 - ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m always open to insights into Rust optimization and best practices in low-latency systems.
 - ðŸ’¬ Ask me about C++ workflows, image processing, and real-time communication.
