Hi there 
As a software engineer with a keen eye for technical precision and user-focused design, my background spans C++ workflows, and I enjoy building interfaces with React, Node.js, and Electron. I’ve also worked on real-time communication solutions, including an intranet-based video conference application powered by WebRTC.

 -  I’m exploring advancements in real-time communication and system integrations.
 -  I’m always open to insights into Rust optimization and best practices in low-latency systems.
 -  Ask me about C++ workflows, image processing, and real-time communication.
 -  How to reach me: manoj235p@gmail.com
 -  I’m also a traditional artist, and love to experiment with Physics!
